            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p class="info">Welcome to V Study Room, a project born from the collective passion and dedication of four engineering students who believe in the power of collaboration and focused learning.</p>
            <h2><span>Our </span>Story</h2>
            <p class="info">We are Bhavith Shetty, Prakyat Shetty, Swaraj Shinde, and Taha Sayedâ€”four friends and fellow engineering students who came together with a shared vision: to create a platform that empowers students to achieve their academic goals through a community-driven approach. As we navigated the challenges of our engineering studies, we realized how beneficial it was to have a dedicated space where we could focus, share resources, and motivate each other. This experience inspired us to develop V Study Room, a digital study environment designed to help students like us stay productive, connect with peers, and succeed in their studies.</p>
            <h2><span>Our </span>Mission</h2>
            <p class="info">Our mission is simple: to provide a supportive and distraction-free study space that fosters productivity and academic excellence. We believe that by studying together, we can all achieve more than we could alone. Whether you're tackling tough engineering problems, preparing for exams, or simply looking for a place to concentrate, V Study Room is here to help you on your journey.</p>
            <h2><span>Join</span> us</h2>
            <p class="info">Join us as we continue to grow and expand V Study Room. Together, we can create a community where learning is not just an individual effort, but a collective experience. Thank you for being a part of our journey!</p>
